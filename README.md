plot is a plotting library with the focus on visualizing benchmark results.

Everything here is subject to change.

# TODO

* [ ] Add text box
* [ ] Implement text origin
* [ ] Create coordinate abstraction, so that density / violin and other plots can be rotated by just swapping their axes.
* [ ] Implement column bar charts
* [ ] Implement percentiles
* [ ] Create an abstraction for dataset, so that sorting can be reused
* [ ] Add color and style palettes
* [ ] Fix density plot scaling
* [ ] Fix violin plot scaling
